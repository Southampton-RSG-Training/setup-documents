## Download Data for Spreadsheets Lesson ##

For the purposes of training, this data has been simplified a bit (you can still download the full dataset and work with it using exactly the same tools we will learn here). This simplified version of data is available from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459). In this lesson, you will need to download the following five files from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459):
-  [messy_survey_data.xls](data/messy_survey_data.xlsx) - this is the main file we will work with. It includes messy survey data
(in Excel's `.xlsx` format) that you will clean during the lesson and use to learn some best practices in
data organisation.
